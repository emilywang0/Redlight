          In RedLight, our mission was to create a user-friendly interactive website that will combat human and child trafficking through debugging the taboo and dense information surrounding them. This was done through illustrating the issue, providing information on resources, and anything our audience would need to be informed.
          <br> <br>
          This website was developed in the most different of backgrounds and unlikeliest of circumstances during a Kode with Klossy virtual camp. Through this opportunity, three young women across three different nations have made a fully fuctional website dedicated to fighting against human trafficking in their own way.
